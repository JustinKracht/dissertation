In this dissertation, I conducted a simulation study to compare several methods for simulating population correlation matrices with model error. The model-error methods I compared were the Cudeck and Browne [CB; @cudeck1992] method, the Wu and Browne [WB; @wu2015] method, and three variations of the Tucker, Koopman, and Linn [TKL; @tucker1969] model-error method using a novel optimization procudure to automatically select values of the TKL method parameters, $\epsilon$ and $\nu_{\textrm{e}}$. The addition of the optimization procedure allowed the use of the TKL method with specified target values of RMSEA (the $\textrm{TKL}_{\textrm{RMSEA}}$ variation), CFI (the $\textrm{TKL}_{\textrm{CFI}}$ variation), or both fit indices simulataneously (the $\textrm{TKL}_{\textrm{RMSEA/CFI}}$ variation). Moreover, the optimization procedure also allowed users to impose constraints on the loadings of the minor common factors introduced by the TKL method to ensure that there was a clear deliniation between major and minor common factors. To facilitate the use of all of the model-error methods discussed in this dissertation, I also developed an R package (*noisemaker*) that serves as an easy-to-use, unified interface for simulating correlation matrices with model error.
