Covariance structure models such as the common factor model are widely used in psychological research. To investigate the properties of these models and to understand how well various parameter estimation methods are able to estimate population parameter values, researchers often conduct Monte Carlo simulation studies by simulating data from a variety of population models, often incorporating sampling variability to help understand the role of sample size. However, generating data directly from population models has been criticized as unrealistic because the assumption that a population model will fit perfectly in the population will almost always be violated in practice. This discrepancy is known as "model error", and might be due to non-linearities in the relationships between factors and indicators, or due to the effects of large number of common factors that are too weak and too numerous to be of practical interest. Incorporating the effects of model error in Monte Carlo simulation studies is important because it makes simulated data sets more representative of empirical data sets, which are unlikely to have population covariance matrices that are perfectly fit by any simple covariance structure model. Therefore, the inclusion of model error should lead to results that generalize better to empirical settings. To that end, a few model-error methods have been proposed for simulating error-perturbed covariance matrices from the population covariance matrices implied by a covariance structure model. For instance, the Tucker, Koopman, and Linn (TKL; 1969), Cudeck and Browne (1992), and Wu and Browne (2015) model-error methods have variously been proposed.

Although the incorporation of model error in Monte Carlo simulation studies of covariance structure models (particularly the common factor analysis model) has become more common, there are no published comparisons of the model-error methods. Additionally, it is not clear how users should choose parameter values for each of the model-error methods to produce solutions with a particular degree of model fit. The CB and WB model-error methods each have a single user-specified parameter that allows the user to specify a desired root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) value with varying precision. The TKL method has two user-specified parameters that are often chosen by trial-and-error to produce solutions with RMSEA values that are reasonably close to a desired value. This presents at least two problems: First, it is difficult and time-consuming to select TKL parameter values that lead to acceptable RMSEA values over the wide variety of common factor models often used in Monte Carlo simulation studies. Second, RMSEA alone is not sufficient for a complete understanding of the degree of model fit. In the following dissertation, I address these issues as follows. First, I review the psychometric literature on model error, introduce the TKL, CB, and WB model-error methods, and describe four commonly-used fit indices that provide
