There are many people to whom I owe an immense debt of gratitude. I am particularly grateful to my advisor, Niels Waller, who started me down this path and has been a constant guide and mentor. Thank you as well to the other members of my committee, David Weiss, Nate Helwig, and Katerina Marcoulides, for your valuable guidance and support. Thank you to my friends and colleagues in the QPM program, for your friendship and camaraderie; with particular thanks to Allie Cooperman, Kelly Duffy, Lauren Berry, Gretchen Saunders, and Alec Nyce for your advice, encouragement, and feedback. Thank you to my friends and colleagues at General Mills, for cheering me to the finish line; with particular thanks to Stef Bell Egge, Dr. Stacy Davies, and Dr. Jack Kostal for your support and flexibility.  Thank you to Matt Hilgers, Jaime Jarmin, Deniz Çömez, Abbey Leier-Murphy, and Ethan Murphy, whose friendship has kept me going. Thank you to my parents, Harold and Janalee Kracht, and the rest of my family, who have been with me every step of the way. And finally, thank you to my partner, Claudia Ursulescu Kracht: «*Du er det fineste komplimentet jeg noen gang har fått*».
